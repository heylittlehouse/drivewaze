# spcs
spcs is a web application built in 7 days by Michael, Sam, Laura, and Zino as a final project for Dev Bootcamp. The project is conceived as a synthesis of our learning for our time there.

The app itself is essentially AirBnB for driveways, meaning that users, "providers", can rent out their driveway or other available space for parking to other users for a fee. The app utilizes the google maps API for the front page to view listings in the viscinity of where you search and a homemade calendar to narrow your search by available times. Users exchange money via an API call to Stripe, providers having to create their own account, while renters can just supply their credit card information at checkout. We implimented an instant messaging feature using Firebase to allow users to iron out the details of their transaction on their own.  As added features to enhance (re)usability, we allow users to "favorite" other users and listings so that they can repatron the good, and a user and listing rating system, to give feedback.
